** First-Class
*** The Ten Commandments

 * The First Commandment

   When recurring on a list of atoms, /lat/, ask two questions about it: ~(null?
   lat)~ and *else*.

   When recurring on a number, /n/, ask two questions about
   it: ~(zero? n)~ and *else*.

   When recurring on a list of S-expressions, /l/, ask three questions about it:
   ~(null? l)~, ~(atom? (car l))~, and *else*.

 * The Second Commandment

   Use ~cons~ to build lists.

 * The Third Commandment

   When building a list, describe the first typical element, and then ~cons~ it
   onto the natural recursion.

 * The Fourth Commandment

   Always change at least one argument while recurring. When recurring on a list
   of atoms, /lat/, use ~(cdr lat)~. When recurring on a number, /n/, use ~(sub1
   n)~. And when recurring on a list of S-expressions, /l/, use ~(car l)~ and
   ~(cdr l)~ if neither ~(null? l)~ nor ~(atom? (car l))~ are true.

   It must be changed to be closer to the termination. The changing argument
   must be tested in the termination condition:
   + when using /cdr/, test termination with ~null?~ and
   + when using /sub1/, test termination with ~zero?~.
